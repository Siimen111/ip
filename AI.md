# AI Usage

## AI Tool/s used

- ChatGPT 5.2
- ChatGPT 5.2-codex (medium)
- AI Assistant (Idea Plugin)

## How was AI used?

- Helped with refactoring code
  - Extraction of subclasses like Parser & Storage
  - Implementation of extension (C-FriendlierSyntax): further extraction of the storage and parser classes required, AI helped with guiding me through the steps for implementing the new alias system
- Gave advice on how to solve certain bugs/issues

## Limits of AI/LLM generation

- After having a relatively long conversation with the AI assistant (~20 prompts), the AI would tend to drift from the initial set of instructions, and would also "forget" some of the previous prompts as well.
- The AI would sometimes recommend outdated/unusual ways to implementing a method
  - Using old Java 8 syntax for streams (.collect(Collectors.toList()), etc.)
