  - A-BetterGui
    - helped with JavaFX syntax (Circular profile picture)

    - Gave some suggestions on what common JUnit tests should be in place

## Limits of AI/LLM generation

- After having a relatively long conversation with the AI assistant (~20 prompts), the AI would tend to drift from the initial set of instructions, and would also "forget" some of the previous prompts as well.
- The AI would sometimes recommend outdated/unusual ways to implementing a method
  - Using old Java 8 syntax for streams (.collect(Collectors.toList()), etc.)
